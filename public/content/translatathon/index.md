    <h3>How much time do I have to commit?</h3>
    As much as you want. The minimum threshold to be eligible for participatory prizes is 100 translated words, which takes about 10-20 minutes to complete, while competing for the top prizes will require a larger time commitment.

    <h3>Do I need to be familiar with Ethereum?</h3>
    No. While being familiar with Ethereum can help with your productivity and quality, the Translatathon is as much a learning experience as it is a competition, and everyone is invited to join and learn more about Ethereum while participating.
